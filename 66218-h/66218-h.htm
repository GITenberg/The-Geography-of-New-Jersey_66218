<p>The original inhabitants of New Jersey H
were Indians of the Delaware tribe, which
belonged to the Algonquin family. The
early white settlers were of different nationalities,&mdash;Dutch,
Swedes, English, and French.
The geographical names of the state are
interesting reminders of the various occupants.</p>

</div>

<p>The first exploration of the state was
made by Henry Hudson, who, in the employ
of the Dutch East
India Company, sailed for a
week in 1609 on the waters
of Delaware Bay and Delaware
River, which the Dutch
called South River, in search
of a northwest passage to
India. Failing to find it,
he sailed north and entered
New York Bay and Hudson
River, or North River, as it
is still called. In 1614 the
Dutch founded New Amsterdam,
afterwards New
York, and, about the same
time, established a trading
post in what is now Hudson
County. Later the Swedes
attempted settlements in
the southwestern part of
the state, but were expelled by the Dutch.
The Dutch made settlements at various
places, some of which proved to be only
temporary. The first permanent settlement
in New Jersey was at Bergen, now a part of
Jersey City, to which was granted a town
form of government, separate from that of
New Amsterdam, in 1660.</p>

<p>In 1664 the English took possession of
New Netherland&mdash;the Dutch Colony including
New York and New Jersey, King Charles
II granted it to his brother, the Duke of
York, who in turn granted that part of it
lying between the Hudson and Delaware
rivers to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George
Carteret. The latter had been governor of
the Isle of Jersey, and their new grant was
named New Jersey in his honor. Disagreements
between Carteret and Berkeley led
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the latter to sell his interest to other proprietors,</span><br />
among whom afterwards was William
Penn. In 1676 the
colony was divided into
East Jersey and West Jersey
by a line running from
Little Egg Harbor to the
Delaware in the northern
part of the state. It is because
of this division that
the state is still often referred
to as "the Jerseys."
In 1702 the proprietors surrendered
their proprietary
rights to the crown. From
that time to its independence
the whole of New
Jersey was under royal
government.</p>

<p>Five representatives from
New Jersey signed the Declaration
of Independence.
The position of the state made it "The
War Path of the Revolution." Paulus
Hook, Springfield, Morristown, Monmouth,
Princeton, and Trenton are famous names in
Revolutionary history. The troops of the
state were in every conflict. In the army of
General Wayne, which punished the Indians
after the Wyoming massacre, one third were
New Jersey soldiers under General Maxwell.</p>

<p>New Jersey lies between 73&deg; 55&#8242; and 75&deg;
32&#8242; west longitude and between 38&deg; 56&#8242; and
41&deg; 21&#8242; north latitude. Its northernmost
point is marked by a rock on the shore
of the Delaware River just south of Port
Jervis, New York, known as Tri-States Rock.
From this point to Cape May the length
of the state is 166 miles. Its narrowest
part, between Trenton and Raritan Bay, is
335 miles wide. Its widest part, measured
on a line extending northwest from Great
Egg Inlet, is 57 miles wide.</p>

<p>It is the smallest of the Middle Atlantic
states and has an area of 8224 square miles,
of which 7514 square miles are land surface
and 710 square miles are water surface.
It is the forty-fifth of the states in size.</p>

  <div class="caption">Topographic provinces of New Jersey</div>
</div>

<p>In a general way the surface of New
Jersey may be described as mountainous in
the northern part, undulating in the middle
part, and low and sandy in the southern
part. The state is divided into four provinces
or zones; namely, the Appalachian
zone, the Highlands, the Piedmont Plateau,
and the Coastal Plain. These zones extend
from southwest to northeast.</p>

<p>The Appalachian zone, which consists of
Kittatinny Mountain and Kittatinny Valley,
extends across the northwestern part of
the state from the Delaware River in the
vicinity of the Delaware Water Gap to the
New York state line. The width of this
belt varies from twelve to fourteen miles.
The Kittatinny Mountain extends along
the Delaware River for thirty miles in the
northwestern corner of the state. It extends
into Pennsylvania, where it is known as
Blue Mountain. The height of this range
varies from 1500 feet to 1800 feet. Its
highest point and the highest in the state
is High Point, which has an elevation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">-v-</span>
1804 feet. The Kittatinny Valley is on
the southeast side of Kittatinny Mountain
and runs parallel with it.</p>

<p>The Appalachian zone, with its rugged
surface, extensive forests, and many lakes,
is noted for its beautiful scenery, which
attracts many summer visitors. The Delaware
Water Gap is particularly noted on
this account. This is a break in the Kittatinny
Mountain through which the Delaware
River flows. Because of the rough
surface this section of the state is not
adapted to agriculture, although on the
bottom lands bordering on the streams and
in the Kittatinny Valley there are many
farms devoted to the raising of crops and
to grazing.</p>

<p>The second zone, The Highlands, immediately
southeast of the Appalachian zone,
extends from the Delaware River into New
York. Its southeastern boundary passes
near Morristown and Boonton. This zone
is from ten to twenty miles wide. Its height
generally varies from 900 feet to 1400 feet.
Hamburg Mountain and Wawayanda Mountain
reach an altitude of 1469 feet. The
Highlands, as well as the Appalachian zone,
belong to the Appalachian region, but in
New Jersey the term "Appalachian" is
applied only to the region consisting of
Kittatinny Mountain and Valley.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="nj_relief_map" style="width: 218px;">
  <a href="images/nj_relief_map_lg.png"><img src="images/nj_relief_map.png" width="218" height="387" alt="" /></a>
  <div class="caption">Relief map of New Jersey</div>
</div>

<p>The Highlands contain many irregular
mountain masses, interspersed with fertile
valleys, and much forest land. The zone
contains, besides, many lakes, most of which
are of glacial origin. The section is consequently
one of great natural beauty, and is
a popular resort for many who desire out-door
recreation. There is much fertile farm
land and land suitable for grazing. Parts
of it are specially suitable for the raising of
peaches and other fruits. It contains many
valuable mineral deposits, including gravel,
cement rock, zinc, and iron.</p>

<p>Next to the Highlands and parallel with
it is the Piedmont Plateau. This extends
from the Delaware River to the northeast
corner of the state and is about thirty miles
wide. Its southeastern boundary is a line
running from Trenton to Woodbridge in
Middlesex County, which represents in this
state the Fall Line (Sec. 47). It comprises
about one fifth of the area of the state. Its
elevation varies from sea level to about
900 feet.</p>

<p>The Piedmont Plateau is characterized by
the presence of red sandstone and shale.
Its surface is very irregular. In its eastern
part it is undulating or rolling. In the
western, it contains higher lands which may
be called plateaus. It contains also irregular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">-vi-</span>
ridges such as the Watchung
Mountains, the Palisades,
and the mountains in Hunterdon
County. The Watchung
Mountains and the Palisades
are composed of trap rock,
which in a molten condition
was forced up through overlying
rock strata. The eastern
sides of these trap ridges
are steep slopes. The underlying
sandstone has been worn
away while the harder trap rock has resisted
erosion.</p>

  <div class="caption">The Palisades of the Hudson</div>
</div>

<p>The Falls of the Passaic River at Paterson
are located in this section. These falls,
which are seventy feet high, were formed by
the water passing over the hard trap rock
and wearing away the softer rock below.</p>

<p>Because of the nearness of the Piedmont
Plateau to the great commercial centers of
the country and the excellent facilities for
transportation, most of the larger cities of
the state are located in this zone.</p>

  <div class="caption">Barnegat lighthouse></div>
</div>

<p>The fourth zone, the Coastal Plain, includes
the remainder of the state south and east of
the Fall Line. The land of this zone is highest
in the interior along a range of elevations
extending from Atlantic Highlands in the
northeast to Mount Holly in the southwest,
and slopes outward from
these elevations towards the
margins of the zone. The
greatest elevation is 390 feet,
which is found in Monmouth
County. About three fourths
of this portion of the state
has an elevation of less than
100 feet and about one third
has an elevation of less than
50 feet. The Coastal Plain is
bordered along Delaware Bay
and the Atlantic Coast by salt marshes, or
tidal marshes, often called salt meadows,
whose elevation above sea level is rarely as
much as four feet. The total area of these
marshes, including those of the valley of the
Hackensack River, is almost 660 square miles.
Along the Atlantic coast the marshes are
separated from the ocean by beaches. These
are low ridges of sand, constructed in the
shallow water by the action of the waves
and wind. These beaches are absent along
the shore of Delaware Bay and along the
coast from Manasquan to Monmouth Beach.
The water between the beaches and the mainland
is shallow and is becoming more shallow
because of the deposit of sediment which is
washed down from the land by streams.</p>

<p>Although the coast line of the state along
the Atlantic is 120 miles
long, there are no good
harbors on this line,
because of the barrier
beaches and the shallowness
of the water between
the beaches and
the mainland.</p>

  <div class="caption">Lake Drive, Greenwood Lake</div>
</div>

<p>The northern fourth of
New Jersey was covered
by ice during the Glacial
Period (Sec. 32). It
therefore contains many
moraines, or deposits of
material carried along by
the glacier. These deposits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">-vii-</span>
consist of clay, sand, gravel, and
bowlders. In some places they take the
form of hills or ridges, in others they are
spread out as level sheets. Some valleys
are partly filled by them. Many lakes in
the northern part of the state occupy basins
which were scooped out by the glacier, or
were formed from river valleys whose outlets
were blocked by glacial deposits. The
terminal moraine which marks the southern
limit of the glacier extends from Belvidere,
through Morristown, to Perth Amboy. As
the ice passed over the hard rocks of the
mountains it polished their surfaces, and left
in them scratches, which indicate the general
southward movement of the glacier.</p>

<p>The Coastal Plain was once beneath the
ocean and was part of the continental shelf
which extends along the Atlantic. The ancient
shore is now the Fall Line.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CLIMATE">CLIMATE</h2>
</div>


<p>The climate of New Jersey is milder and
less subject to extreme fluctuation than
that of the interior states in the same latitude,
because it extends along the ocean (Sec.
107). The average annual temperature of
New Jersey is 51.5&deg;. The average annual
temperature of the extreme northern part
is 5&deg; lower than that of the extreme southern
end of the state. The lower temperature
of the northern part of the state is due to
the higher latitude, its distance from the
ocean, and its greater altitude.</p>

<p>The prevailing winds are from the west
and northwest. New Jersey is in the track
of storms, which cross the continent from the
west. The south and east winds blowing
from the ocean toward the storm centers
bring with them much moisture and insure
the state an ample rainfall. Local showers
or thunderstorms which move from the
west or northwest are frequent in the spring
and summer months. In the summer time
all along the coast the benefit of sea breezes
is felt (Sec. 372).</p>

<p>The rainfall is sufficient for all kinds of
crops which can be grown in the state. It
is greatest in the northeastern part of the
state, where the annual precipitation is more
than fifty inches; and least in the southern
and southwestern part along Delaware Bay,
where it is about forty-one inches.</p>

  <div class="caption">Drainage basins in New Jersey</div>
</div>


<p>The divide between the streams that
flow into the Delaware River and Delaware
Bay on the west and those that flow into the
Hudson River, Newark Bay, New York
Bay, Raritan Bay, Sandy Hook Bay, and
Atlantic Ocean on the east is a very irregular
line extending from the northwest corner
of the state to Cape May. It is so near the
Delaware River and Delaware Bay that only
a little more than one third of the state is
drained into these waters. The tributaries
which drain this basin are, therefore, small.
The eastern drainage area contains several
rivers of considerable size. The Wallkill
River flows northeast through the northwestern
part of this state and through the
southeast corner of New York into the
Hudson River. The Hackensack River rises
in New York and flows south into Newark
Bay. The Passaic River, which has as
tributaries Saddle River, Pompton River,
Ramapo River, Wanaque River with Greenwood
Lake, Pequannock River, and Rockaway
River, follows a very tortuous course
and flows into Newark Bay. Just north of
the middle of the state is the Raritan River,
which rises near the Delaware River and
flows into Raritan Bay.</p>

<p>All the rivers which flow into the Atlantic
Ocean or into the bays which border the
state are affected by the tidal flow, and the
largest are navigable for at least some parts
of their courses. In the case of the Delaware
the tide extends to Trenton. Important
cities which are located on tidal waters
are Hoboken, Jersey City, Bayonne, Newark,
Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Perth Amboy,
Long Branch, Asbury Park, Atlantic City,
Camden, and Trenton.</p>

<p>Between the Watchung Mountains on the
east and south and the Highlands on the
northwest is a broad, flat basin, which is
drained by the Passaic River. Before the
Glacial Period the Passaic River did not flow
from this basin through the mountains at
Little Falls and Paterson, as it does now.
This area was then drained by a stream
which crossed the Watchung Mountains
near Summit and Millburn and flowed southeast
into the sea. During the Glacial Period
most of this basin was covered by the ice
sheet. As the ice receded, this gap in the
Watchung Mountains was filled with glacial
drift and there was formed a large lake,
which the geologists call Lake Passaic and
which was drained for a long time by a
stream which flowed southwest through the
hills near Liberty Corner into the Raritan
River. As the ice sheet receded still farther
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">-ix-</span>
north, the gaps through the mountains at
Little Falls and Paterson were exposed. As
these gaps are lower than the older outlets,
the water of Lake Passaic escaped through
them over the present course of the Passaic
River to Newark Bay, and the lake disappeared.
These changes in the drainage of
the Passaic basin explain the presence of
much swampy land in this section.</p>

<p>The water power generated by the rapid
descent of the streams in the part of the
state lying north of the Fall Line has long
been utilized for manufacturing purposes,
and mills are found along all the streams in
this part of the state. The location of
Paterson as a manufacturing center is due to
the water power developed from the Passaic
Falls. At Trenton, water power is secured
from the rapids of the Delaware River. In
the northern part of the state, several
streams and lakes are used to provide electric
power and light.</p>

<p>Closely connected with drainage systems
and dependent largely upon them are the
methods of supplying water to the people
of towns and cities for domestic purposes.
Formerly water for such purposes was obtained
from near-by springs, wells, and
streams. As population increased, the local
sources of water supply became contaminated
and dangerous to health. This danger
and the larger quantity of water required
by the increased population and by manufacturing
interests have forced the larger
cities to make provision for securing their
water supply from sources, more or less
remote, which are not subject to pollution.
Their water-supply systems include pumping
stations, reservoirs for storage, and long
pipe lines. The drainage basins from which
water is taken for municipal purposes are
located in the thinly populated parts of the
state. The northern mountainous section,
which is not specially profitable for agriculture
and other purposes, is particularly
useful in furnishing sources of water supply.
The many large cities in the northern part
of the state draw their water from the
upper parts of the Hackensack, Passaic,
and Raritan basins. Formerly Newark and
Jersey City drew their water from the
Passaic River not far above the former city.
This river was gradually so polluted by the
sewage and the waste of factories discharged
into it, that it had to be abandoned as a
source of supply. These cities now bring
their water long distances, Newark using the
Pequannock basin, and Jersey City the
Rockaway. In some cases water is obtained
from artesian wells.</p>

<p>The pollution of streams by city sewers
and drains from factories destroys fish in
fresh-water streams. The damage extends
even into tidal waters, and many oyster
and clam fisheries in the bays have been
abandoned. The state is alive to the necessity
of protecting its streams against contamination
of all kinds and has enacted
legislation designed to maintain their purity
by preventing the flow of sewage and other
objectionable matter into them. It has
provided for the construction of a trunk-line
sewer along the valley of the Passaic
from Paterson to the sea, into which the
sewers of the cities along its course will be
discharged. In cooperation with Pennsylvania
the state has passed laws to prevent
the pollution of the Delaware River.</p>

<p><b>Forests.</b>&mdash;When the state was first settled
it was covered with a vast primeval forest,
consisting of pine, oak, maple, chestnut,
hickory, ash, walnut, tulip, poplar, and
cedar. For many years lumbering was an
important industry, but it ceased a long
time ago, after the best timber had been
cut down. In the northern part of the
state, where agriculture is difficult or impossible,
the mountains are still covered with
forests which promise to be of great value
in the future. In the southern part, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">-x-</span>
section called "The Pines" is covered with
stunted pines mingled with scrub oak. In
all parts of the state are isolated forested
areas of varied extent. About forty per
cent of the total land surface of the state is
covered with forest growth.</p>

<p>Until a very recent period no organized
efforts were made to protect forest trees
against forest fires or other destructive
agencies, or to provide for reforestation.
The state has, however, realized the commercial
value of its forests and the importance
of promoting their growth on lands
that are not available for farming purposes.
The state has also recognized the value of
forests in preventing floods (Secs. 93, 136,
224). In recent years an additional reason
for forest protection is the necessity of preserving
the soils of the forested areas in the
drainage basins from which the cities obtain
their supply of water, so that by the storage
of water in the soils and underlying rock
strata the supply may at all times be constant
and sufficient. The use of trees for shade
and wind breaks and their natural beauty
also justify their protection and care. For
these reasons the state has adopted legislation
which provides for the growth of trees
and forests. It owns and maintains six
forest reserves located in different parts
of the state, containing nearly 14,000 acres,
which are being devoted to forest culture.
It has authorized the counties to create
extensive parks and has provided for the
diffusion of important information regarding
the care of forests. It maintains lookout
stations from which forest fires may be
detected, and a force of firewardens to prevent
or extinguish fires and to arrest those
who cause them. This state and New York,
acting together, have created the Palisades
Interstate Park, which embraces thousands
of acres of forest land in the latter state and
the Palisades for a distance of twelve miles
along the Hudson in New Jersey.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Animals.</b>&mdash;The larger wild animals have
practically disappeared, although the red
deer is still frequently found in the northern
and southern parts of the state because of
the protection afforded this animal by the
laws. Here are, also, still many of the
smaller animals, such as the rabbit and
squirrel. In many parts of the state wild
ducks and quail are numerous.</p>

<p>The fresh-water streams and lakes abound
in bass, trout, pickerel, and perch. In the
spring the shad fisheries along the Delaware
are very profitable. The catch of sturgeon
is also very large. All these waters are constantly
restocked by means of the hatcheries
near Hackettstown which the state maintains.
The shad fisheries of the Hudson
were formerly extensive, but owing chiefly
to destructive methods of fishing and to the
pollution of the river this industry has
practically disappeared.</p>

<p>The sheltered bays and inlets of the state
and the nearness of the fisheries to the
markets have made the salt water fisheries
very successful. Bluefish and weakfish for
food, and menhaden for oil and fertilizer are
caught along the coast in large quantities,
while in the bays and coves immense quantities
of oysters and clams are gathered.
Important centers of this industry are Keyport,
Barnegat Bay, Tuckerton, Absecon,
Maurice River Cove, and Bivalve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</h2>
</div>


<p><b>Soils.</b>&mdash;In the northern part of the state
the sides of the higher mountains are steep
and are in many places denuded of soil. In
the valleys and on the hills north of the
terminal moraine the soil
consists largely of glacial
drift, which is composed of
clay, sand, and gravel mixed
with bowlders. This soil is
fertile, but a large part of it
is not easy to cultivate, because
of the large stones in
It and because of the rugged
surface. South of the terminal
moraine, in the Highlands
and in the Piedmont
Plateau, the soil is composed
of gravel and sand washed
down by streams from the
glacial deposits farther north
and of disintegrated underlying rocks, which
in the Highlands consisted largely of gneiss
and in the Piedmont Plateau of sandstones
and shales. The soil of the Coastal Plain
consists of extensive deposits of gravel, sand,
clay, and marl deposited in the ocean, which
once covered this region. The gravel, sand,
and clay were carried into it by the streams
which flowed from the north. The marl consists
largely of very small shells of animals
that lived in the sea. This mixed soil is
very fertile, particularly that in which there
is an abundance of marl. This is found in
the "Marl Belt," which is a strip of land
extending from the Atlantic Highlands southwest
past Trenton and Mount Holly as far as
Salem. Its width varies, being widest at its
northeastern end and becoming narrower
and less rich in marl toward the southwest.
Formerly marl was used extensively as a
fertilizer to enrich poorer soils, but it has
been generally displaced by the richer commercial
fertilizers. The so-called "Pine Barrens"
which cover a large part of the Plain,
east of the Marl Belt, are comparatively
unproductive, but by proper cultivation and
the application of fertilizers, these areas can
be made very productive.</p>

  <div class="caption">Gathering peaches, New Jersey</div>
</div>

<p><b>Crops.</b>&mdash;In the production of grain crops
the state cannot, on account of its varied
surface and its small farms,
compete with the western
states with their great plains
and large farms. Wheat is
produced mainly for local
consumption. Corn is grown
in large quantities in all parts
of the state. Rye and buckwheat
are also raised in
limited quantities. Much
of the land, particularly
that which is not adapted
to the growth of other crops,
is devoted to pasture and
hay. Many circumstances
are extremely favorable to
special agricultural industries whose products
are vegetables, fruits, flowers, poultry, eggs,
milk, and butter. These are: the climate,
with its mild winters and generous rainfall;
the fertility of the soil; the large permanent
population of the state; the presence of
thousands of visitors from other states at the
summer resorts of the state; the nearness of
the farm lands of the state to the great cities
of New York and Philadelphia; and the excellent
facilities for the rapid transportation
of agricultural products to the markets.</p>

<p>The constant demand of the large cities
makes market gardening very profitable, and
this industry is carried on in all parts of the
state, but with special intensity in those sections
which are near the cities. All kinds of
vegetables are raised. Of these the potato
crop is the most valuable. In the southern
counties, which have a sandy soil, large
crops of sweet potatoes are produced. This
section is also prominent in the cultivation
of tomatoes, beans, and peas, great quantities
of which are used in the canning industry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">-xii-</span>
Cabbages, celery, and onions are valuable
products. The demand for fresh, early vegetables
has encouraged market gardeners to
devote increased attention to growing vegetables
under glass.</p>

<p>Fruits of all kinds are raised in all parts
of the state. In the northwestern section
of the state, in parts of Warren, Morris,
and Hunterdon counties, peaches are grown
in great quantities on the stony soil of the
glacial drift which is not favorable to general
farming. In the western section apples
and pears are abundant. While strawberries,
blackberries, raspberries, and grapes
are grown in all parts of the state, they are
grown in special abundance in the southern
part of the state. In this section establishments
for the bottling of unfermented grape
juice have grown up. Huckleberries are
common in the wooded sections of the
northern and southern parts of the state.
Cranberry bogs are found in Atlantic, Burlington,
and Ocean counties.</p>

  <div class="caption">Poultry buildings, New Jersey Experimental Station, New Brunswick</div>
</div>

<p><b>Animal Products.</b>&mdash;Dairy farming is successful
in all parts of the state, particularly in
the sections in which pasture and hay are
easily obtained, and in which
facilities for the prompt transportation
of milk to the
cities are at hand. Milk is
produced not only by the
general farmer but also by
special dairy farms, which,
by devoting special attention
to the care and feeding of
cattle and to the handling of
the milk, produce milk of a superior quality.
Poultry raising and the production of
eggs are profitable. The poultry industry is
especially extensive in Cumberland, Atlantic,
and Ocean counties.</p>

<p>With the increase in the population of the
cities the farm land of the state is growing
in extent and value, but it is clear that more
rapid growth is possible and desirable. The
State Agricultural School at Rutgers College,
with Its Experiment Station and practical
courses of instruction, is doing much to
improve agriculture in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Iron ore is found in many parts of the
state. The mines of Morris County in the
Highlands are the most productive. Iron
ore was smelted at Shrewsbury in the seventeenth
century by Colonel Lewis Morris,
and in many places at the time of the Revolution.
The iron industry of the state was
most extensive and successful during the
third quarter of the last century. The
greater abundance and richness of western
ores has since made it impossible to operate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">-xiii-</span>
most of the mines and furnaces of Warren
and Morris counties profitably. The industry
has therefore declined. A few mines
are still worked, however, in these two
counties. Very rich zinc mines are located
in Sussex County, in the neighborhood of
Franklin Furnace. In the production of
zinc this state ranks fifth among the states
of the Union.</p>

<p>Granite of good quality is found in the
Appalachian and Highland zones. The
quarrying of this material is a rapidly growing
industry. Besides granite the sandstone
of the Piedmont Plateau is widely
used for building purposes. Slate is quarried
to some extent in Sussex and Warren counties.
Talc, or soapstone, which, ground
into powder, is used in making certain kinds
of paper and for other purposes, is found in
Warren County. The production of cement
from limestone and shale, found in the
western part of the Highlands near Phillipsburg,
has grown to be a very important
industry. This industry and the quarrying
of slate are parts of the great cement and
slate industries of the adjacent section of
Pennsylvania, across the Delaware, near
Easton, which are among the most important
in the country. The trap rock of the
Piedmont Plateau is used for building purposes,
road making, and railroad beds. Its
hardness makes it particularly valuable for
macadam roads. In all parts of the state
are found deposits of sand and gravel necessary
in building operations.</p>

<p>The beds of marl found in the Coastal
Plain have already been mentioned. This
region also contains very valuable beds of
white sand and fine clay. This sand is
used in the making of glass, and has caused
the establishment of many glass factories
in the southwestern part of the state. Molding
sand is also found in great quantity.
The most extensive beds of clay are found
in Mercer and Middlesex counties. In the
former they are used in the making of pottery
and in the latter in the making of brick,
terra cotta, tile, and other clay products.
The enormous industries of Trenton and of
Perth Amboy and its vicinity are due to the
presence of these clays. For the finer pottery,
clays brought from other states or
countries are used. Much clay is shipped
from this state to other states.</p>

<p><b>Manufacturing.</b>&mdash;New Jersey is an important
manufacturing state. In this state
the manufacturing industries have been developed
in a remarkable degree by a combination
of conditions and causes. Very early
in the history of New Jersey the people
of the state were forced by their own needs
and the demands of their neighbors to establish
manufacturing, and thus this industry
has the advantage of many years of growth.
The state is rich in certain important natural
resources, which have been mentioned. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">-xiv-</span>
has profited greatly by its nearness to the
coal and iron fields of Pennsylvania and to
the two great cities of New York and Philadelphia,
with their enormous demands for
manufactured products. The number of intelligent
and skillful workers in the state
is unusually large. The facilities for rapid
transportation, both of raw materials from
all sources and of finished products to all
markets, are unusually abundant. The navigable
waters which fringe the state, and the
transcontinental railroad systems with their
branches, which cross it, facilitate shipments
to every part of the world.</p>

<p>Among the most important manufactures
of New Jersey are refined copper, silk and
silk goods, foundry and machine shop products,
petroleum products, packed meats,
woolen and felt goods, wire, leather and
leather goods, electrical machinery, tobacco
manufactures, chemicals, and ships. (See
Table II for other manufactures.)</p>

<p>Nearly one sixth of the people of the state
are engaged in the manufacturing industries.
Only four states, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, and New Hampshire, show
a larger proportion of workers engaged in
manufacturing. Although New Jersey is
forty-fifth in area and ninth in population,
this state is sixth in the total value of manufactured
goods, first in the manufacture of
silk and silk goods, in the smelting and refining
of copper, in the manufacture of oil
cloth and linoleum and of sewing machines,
second in the manufacture of chemicals,
rubber goods, pottery, terra cotta, and fine
clay products, and of paint and varnish, third
in the manufacture of electrical machinery
and supplies, and fourth in the manufacture
of soap and gold and silver articles.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRAVEL_AND_TRANSPORTATION">TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION</h2>
</div>


<p>In the early days of the state communication
between the settlements was by
Indian trails, which, as travel increased,
expanded into roads. Settlements on the
coast were also connected by sailing vessels.
The roads gradually increased in number
and length as the interior of the state was
developed. Little effort was made, however,
toward keeping the public roads in good
condition. The difficulties of travel and
transportation led to the construction of
many "turnpikes," or roads built by private
companies, which charged tolls for their
use. With very few exceptions these have
been made public roads.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century
the foundations of transportation by steamboat,
canals, and railroads were laid. The
Morris Canal, from Phillipsburg to Jersey
City, was projected and constructed to
bring anthracite coal from Pennsylvania
to the iron forges of northern New Jersey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">-xv-</span>
and to New York Bay, and to connect the
towns along its route with the city of New
York. The Delaware and Raritan Canal,
from Bordentown to New Brunswick, the
Camden and Amboy Railroad, and the New
Jersey Railroad were constructed in order
to increase transportation facilities between
Philadelphia and New York harbor. Now
all parts of the state are connected with each
other and with those great centers by many
railroad lines. The importance of our railroads
has been much increased by the development
of the West and by the geographical
location of the state in the path of direct
communication between the western states
and the city of New York. All the trunk
lines from the Middle West, with one exception,
pass through New Jersey, and have
terminals in Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken.
The state has 2464 miles of railroad,
a greater mileage compared with its
area than any other state. Besides, there
are 1294 miles of electric railway which
traverse all parts of the state and connect
all important points.</p>

  <div class="caption">Oil refinery and tanks, Elizabethport</div>
</div>

<p>Because of the superior advantages of
railroads, the canals are now obsolete, the
Morris Canal being practically abandoned.
The traffic between New York and Philadelphia
is growing so rapidly that it is probable
that the Delaware and Raritan Canal
may be widened and deepened and thus may
become a barge or ship canal.</p>

<p>Communication with Pennsylvania over
the Delaware is by means of many ferries
and bridges. There is no bridge between
New Jersey and New York over the Hudson,
but the construction of one has been proposed.
Until 1908 the only means of communication
was by ferries. The Pennsylvania
Railroad now enters New York by tunnels
extending from the Hackensack meadows to
its terminal in the city, and Jersey City and
Hoboken are also connected with New York
by tunnels. In cooperation with the State of
New York, New Jersey has provided for the
construction of a tunnel for vehicles between
Jersey City and New York, and, in cooperation
with Pennsylvania, of a bridge over the Delaware
between Camden and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The state is noted for its excellent roads.
The state and municipalities are spending
vast sums of money on their construction and
maintenance. Funds for state roads, which
are in charge of a State Highway Commission,
are obtained from the issuance of automobile
licenses and from a special road tax.</p>

<p><b>Government.</b>&mdash;The Constitution of New
Jersey divides the government into three
departments,&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial.
The legislative department is vested
in the legislature, which is composed of the
senate and the general assembly. The senate
is composed of one senator from each
county, elected by the voters for three years.
The general assembly is composed of sixty
assemblymen apportioned among the counties
according to population and elected by the
voters for one year. The executive power
is vested in the governor, who is elected for
a term of three years. A person cannot be
governor for two successive
terms. The judicial power is
vested in many courts, of which
the principal are the court of
errors and appeals, which is the
highest court, court of chancery,
supreme court, circuit court,
and courts of common pleas or
county courts. The judges are
appointed by the governor with
the approval of the senate.</p>

<p>The principal state officers,
besides the governor, are secretary
of state, state treasurer, state comptroller,
and attorney-general.</p>

<p>The state is divided into twenty-one
counties, which are again divided into townships,
cities, boroughs, and towns. Each of
these has its own government, which is administered
in accordance with laws passed
by the legislature. The principal county
officers besides the judge are sheriff, county
clerk, surrogate, coroner, county collector,
and members of the board of freeholders
who are elected by vote of the people.</p>

<p>The counties maintain courthouses, penitentiaries,
farms or homes for the aged poor,
and may provide parental homes or detention
homes for juvenile delinquents or juvenile
witnesses.</p>

<p>The state is represented in the United
States Congress by two senators and twelve
representatives.</p>

<p><b>Education.</b>&mdash;The Constitution requires
that "the legislature shall provide for the
maintenance and support of a thorough and
efficient system of free public schools for the
instruction" of the children of the state.
It is because of this requirement and the
desire of the people to enforce it that the
state has such excellent schools.</p>

<p>The principal officers of the state department
of public instruction are the members of
the state board of education, the commissioner
of education, and four assistant commissioners.
Each county has a county superintendent of
schools, and each city and large town has its
own board of education and superintendent
of schools or supervising principal.</p>

<p>In the school year 1919-1920 the number of pupils
who attended the public
schools was 591,798. The
number of teachers was
18,873. Because of good
schools and of compulsory
school attendance, there were
in 1910, only 113,502 illiterates,
or persons of ten years
of age and over who could
not read or write, or 5.6 per

Of these illiterates, 93,000
were of foreign birth and
less than one per cent were
of native white parentage.</p>


<p>State normal schools for the training of
teachers are located at Trenton, Montclair,
Newark, and Glassboro. City normal schools
are maintained for the same purpose by Jersey
City, Paterson, Trenton, and Camden.
The state maintains summer schools for the
preparation of teachers and makes appropriations
to the State Agricultural College,
a department of Rutgers College at New
Brunswick. Special schools maintained by
the state are: Farnum School, at Beverly,
which is associated with the Trenton Normal

  <div class="caption">Population of New Jersey</div>
</div>

<p>The population of New Jersey in 1910,
according to the United States Census, was
2,537,168; and the density of population,
or the number of people per square mile,
was 337.7. In 1920, according to the United
States Census, the population was 3,155,900,
an increase of 24.4 per cent., giving a density
of 420. Compared with other states. New
Jersey was tenth in population, and third
in density of population, Rhode Island being
first and Massachusetts second. The area
of greatest density of population is the
northeastern section, including Bergen, Hudson,
Passaic, Essex, Union, and Middlesex
counties, which with an area of 1018 square
miles had a population of 2,112,933, or more
than sixty-five per cent, of the total population
of the state. In this section there
were more than 2000 persons per square
mile. Hudson County, the smallest in the
state, had the largest population, which
was 629,124 or 14,630 per square mile. In
Hoboken, with an area of less than two square
miles, the population was more than 68,000 or
more than 34,000 to the square mile. Other
thickly populated sections are those of which
Trenton and Camden are centers. Cape May
County had the smallest and Ocean County
the most scattered population, which was
22,155 or 35 per square mile.</p>

<p>The urban population, that is, the number
residing in towns of more than 2500 people,
was 2,486,378 in 1920, or 79 per cent, of the
total population. This still leaves a rural population
of 669,522, or about 90 per square mile,
who are largely engaged in cultivation of the
soil or the raising of stock.</p>

<p>The chief occupations of the people of the
state are agriculture, fishing, manufacturing,
and commerce. Many thousands of people
of New Jersey are engaged in commercial and
industrial enterprises and other business pursuits,
in the large cities of the neighboring
states. Many opportunities for comfortable
residence with all conveniences and advantages
and unsurpassed facilities for rapidly
traveling back and forth attract many to this
state who are employed in the cities of New
York and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>According to the United States Census of
1920 the population of the New York City
Metropolitan District was 7,750,237. Included
in this district are the cities and towns
in Hudson County and in parts of Bergen,
Passaic, Essex, Union, and Middlesex counties,
with a population of 1,795,590. In the
Metropolitan District of Philadelphia, with a
population of over 2,000,000, are parts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">-xx-</span>
Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties
with a population of 239,740. It is clear,
therefore, that the occupations of two thirds
of our people, at least, are subject to the direct
influence of the commercial and industrial
activities of these cities. (The United States
Census Bureau defines a Metropolitan District
as that which embraces the central city
and all cities or parts of cities which lie within
ten miles of its boundaries.)</p>

<p>The cities, towns, boroughs, and villages of
New Jersey may be placed in six groups:
first, those in the New York City Metropolitan
District; second, places lying just outside
the Metropolitan District of New York;
third, Trenton and the towns of the Upper
Delaware Valley; fourth, places in the
Philadelphia Metropolitan District; fifth,
places in the southern part of the state, near
Delaware Bay; sixth, cities and towns on
the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p><b>Metropolitan District of New York.</b>&mdash;The
following are the chief cities of New Jersey
in the Metropolitan District of New York:
Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken, Bayonne,
Paterson, Elizabeth, and Perth Amboy.</p>

<p><b>Newark and its Environs.</b>&mdash;Newark, in
1910, had a population of 347,469 and in
1920 of 414,216. It is the largest city in the
state and fifteenth in the United States.
It was settled in 1666 by settlers from Connecticut.
It is located on the Passaic River
and Newark Bay and has a frontage on the
river and bay of eleven miles. It has water
communication with New York Bay by way
of Newark Bay and Kill van Kull. The
United States government has dredged a
channel in the bay three hundred fifty feet
wide by twenty feet deep. This great improvement
and improvements made by the
city at great expense will greatly increase the
commerce of the city. The city enjoys
excellent railroad facilities. Nine railroads
including the great trunk lines have fourteen
stations in the city. It is directly connected
with the city of New York by passenger trains
which pass through the Hudson tunnels. It
has numerous banks, fine office buildings,
and large department stores. Many trolley
lines which radiate from it bring to it the
trade of the many neighboring cities.</p>

</div>

<p>Newark is the first city in the state in
the variety of its manufactures and in the
value of its manufactured products. It is
eleventh among the cities of the United
States in the value of such products. Its
great progress in manufactures is due to an
early start, to the stimulus given by the
opening of the Morris Canal and by railroad
and water transportation. It has a
large number of important industries which
include smelting and refining, the making of
shoes, leather goods of all kinds, hats, jewelry,
iron, steel, and brass products of all kinds,
watch cases, paints and varnishes, clothing,
electrical machinery and appliances, automobile
supplies, tinware, advertising novelties,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">-xxi-</span>
celluloid products, trunks,
fertilizers, furs, brewery products,
and cigars.</p>

<p>Newark has an excellent
supply of water which is
drawn from the valley of the
Pequannock River in the
northern part of the Passaic
basin, twenty-six miles from
the city.</p>

<p>Surrounding Newark are many
important cities and towns which
reflect the social, commercial,
and industrial influences of that
city as well as those of New York. Among these
are <b>Belleville</b>, <b>Nutley</b>, <b>Montclair</b>, <b>Glen Ridge</b>,
<b>Bloomfield</b>, <b>Orange</b>, <b>East Orange</b>, <b>West Orange</b>,
<b>South Orange</b>, <b>Irvington</b>, and <b>Summit</b>. These are
all largely residential towns whose location and
abundance of eligible sites for homes are attractive.
They are all exceptionally active in providing
educational facilities. They are all
closely connected with Newark and the city of
New York by many railroad and trolley lines. In
most of them land is in such demand for residential
purposes, that it cannot be used profitably
for manufacturing purposes, so that this industry
is naturally discouraged. In some of them, however,
especially those nearest to Newark, large
industrial establishments have grown up. <b>Belleville</b>,
just north of Newark, has long been noted for
its industrial activity and is rapidly growing in
importance in this respect. Nutley, farther to
the north, is well known as a town of beautiful
homes. <b>Montclair</b>, located on the slope of the
Orange Mountains, is noted for its beautiful
scenery, its commanding view of many square miles
of surrounding country with many populous cities,
and its multitude of beautiful homes, and is the
home of one of the state normal schools. <b>Glen
Ridge</b> and <b>Bloomfield</b>, similarly situated, are also
characterized by their fine dwellings. Bloomfield
contains many extensive manufacturing establishments.
Among the products are electrical lamps
and appliances, woolen and worsted goods, colored
labels, cream separators, chemicals, rubber goods,
and iron and steel products. Besides being an
attractive center for residences. <b>Orange</b> is a very
productive industrial center. Its principal industry
is the manufacture of hats. <b>East Orange</b> has
long been famous because of its superior attractiveness
for dwelling purposes and is filled with beautiful
homes. While the high cost of land does not
invite manufactures, several large industries are
located here. Electrical motors and generators,
surgical appliances, electrical appliances, machinery,
lamps, and hats are manufactured in large
quantities. <b>West Orange</b> is noted for the manufacture
of phonographs, phonograph records,
moving picture instruments and films, and storage
batteries. Hats are also extensively manufactured.
<b>South Orange</b> and <b>Summit</b> are most
attractive residential places, and are developing
rapidly along this line rather than in the line of
manufactures. Summit has an important silk
industry. <b>Irvington</b>, while long known as a town
devoted to residences, is feeling the industrial
impulse of Newark, of which it is a suburb, and is
rapidly becoming a manufacturing center of great
importance. Its industries are varied and include
the production of castings, graphite products, tools,
cutlery, and gold, silver, and platinum products.
Across the Passaic River from Newark are
<b>East Newark</b>, <b>Harrison</b>, and <b>Kearney</b>, the last
including <b>Arlington</b>. These municipalities are
located in Hudson County and are, therefore,
officially connected with Jersey City as its county
seat. But they are much nearer Newark, with
which they are closely connected by industrial and
commercial ties. They are prosperous manufacturing
centers with industries of national importance.
In <b>East Newark</b> the most important manufactures
are sewing thread and shade rollers. In
Harrison the industries are varied and the products
include iron and steel, incandescent lamps, steam
pumps, roller bearings, elevators, steel and tin toys,
electric wire, trunks, brass products, tools, metal
novelties, castings, and machinery. In <b>Kearney</b>
the important manufactures are linoleums, yarns,
twine, glue, oils, fertilizers, ships, and castings.</p>

<p><b>Jersey City and its Environs.</b>&mdash;A long
narrow peninsula lies between the Hudson
River and New York Bay on the east, and
the Hackensack River and Newark Bay on
the west. On this peninsula are located
many prosperous cities. On the southern
half, which is in Hudson County, is found
the most densely populated part of the state,
with many large cities of great industrial and
commercial importance.</p>

<p><b>Jersey City</b>, the largest of this group, had,
in 1910, a population of 267,779, and in 1920,
according to the United States Census,
297,864. It is the second city of the state
in size, and twenty-first in the United States.
Parts of it were occupied by the Dutch soon
after New York was settled, but the first
permanent government was established in
1660 at Bergen, which is now a part of the
city. Here were also established the first
school and the first church in the state. It
is located on New York Bay and the Hudson
River and extends westward from these
waters to Newark Bay and the Hackensack
River. It has a frontage on tidal waters
of about twelve miles and has therefore
unexcelled facilities for transportation by
vessels of any size to all the seaports of the
world. Thirteen railroads have terminals
in the city. Besides these, there are eleven
other passenger and freight stations in the
city. Here the railroads bring the products
of all parts of the country directly to the
ships which sail to all parts of the world.</p>

<p>The city is connected directly with the city
of New York by railroads which pass through
tunnels under the Hudson. Numerous
trolley lines connect the different parts of
the city with each other and with other
parts of the state. There are nineteen
banks and trust companies. In manufacturing,
Jersey City ranks second in the state.
Its great commercial and industrial growth
is due to its nearness to New York, to its
connection with that city by ferries and
railroad tunnels, by which passengers and
freight are carried to the heart of the city
of New York in a few minutes, and to the
abundance of facilities for all kinds of transportation.
The most important products
are sugar, printers' type, soaps and perfumes,
meats, silks and embroideries, graphite
products, lead pencils, tobacco, cigars,
iron, steel and brass products, fire hose,
rubber goods, soups, watches, chemicals,
electrical supplies, heating and lighting apparatus,
rope, and paints and varnishes.</p>

<p>The water used by the city is of excellent
quality and is brought from the basin of the
Rockaway River in the northern part of
the state. The city has eight municipal
parks and one county park, containing nearly
two hundred fifty acres. The city maintains
a normal school for the training of its
teachers and has an excellent public library.</p>

<p>Besides being an active industrial center
it is a residential city. Many thousands whose
occupations are in the city of New York live
in Jersey City.</p>

<p>North of Jersey City and adjacent to it is
<b>Hoboken</b>. It is the most densely populated city
in the state. It has connections with several
railroads, and one of the great trunk lines has its
terminal station here. The steamships of several
of the most important transatlantic lines, including
Scandinavian and Dutch, dock in Hoboken.
Hoboken is connected with the city of New York
by the Hudson River tunnels and by ferries and
with other cities of the state by many trolley
lines. Its manufacturing industries include shipbuilding
and repairing and the making of lead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">-xxiii-</span>
pencils, surveying and nautical instruments,
marine engines and boilers, silk goods, furniture,
and wall paper. Here is located the well-known
Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>North of Hoboken and Jersey City are several
cities and towns which are very important industrially
and are rapidly growing in population.
Their nearness to these cities and to each other
makes their industries and interests similar.
These are <b>West Hoboken</b>, <b>Union</b>, <b>West New York</b>,
<b>North Bergen</b>, <b>Weehawken</b>, <b>Guttenberg</b>, and <b>Secaucus</b>.
These are all populous and thriving communities.
There are many valuable industries,
among which the manufacture of silks and embroideries
is the most important. This section
leads the state in the manufacture of embroideries
and is second only to Paterson in that of silk
goods. Other industries are machine shops,
marine construction, and the manufacture of
pianos, lamps, lard, and rubber goods. In <b>Secaucus</b>
vegetable gardening is important.</p>

<p>South of Jersey City lies the city of <b>Bayonne</b>,
which is the third city of the state in the value
of manufactured products. Its frontage on New
York Bay on the east, Newark Bay on the west,
and Kill van Kull on the south, gives it exceptional
facilities for deep-water transportation. It
has, besides, ample railroad facilities. It is the
most important center for the refining of petroleum
in the world. The oil is brought in pipe lines from
the oil fields of Pennsylvania and Ohio to the
refineries, from which the many refined products
are carried to all parts of the world. There are
many other extensive industries, of which the
following may be mentioned: the manufacturing of
steam boilers, iron, steel, and bronze products,
cottonseed oil, nickel and copper
products, borax, insulated wire,
and silk goods.</p>

<p>The northern part of the peninsula,
which is in Bergen County,
contains many attractive towns
which are largely residential in
character. Among them are <b>Englewood</b> and <b>Fort Lee</b>. <b>Edgewater</b>
on the Hudson at the foot
of the Palisades has important
industries. The chief products are
sugar and sirups.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Paterson and Neighboring
Cities and Towns.</b>&mdash;Paterson,
located at the Falls of the
Passaic River, had a population
in 1920 of 135,866 and is the third city of
the state in size. The founding of the city
was suggested by Alexander Hamilton, who
foresaw the value of the power generated by
the falls and made plans to use it for manufacturing
purposes. Its great growth as a
manufacturing center is largely due to this
power. In the value of its manufactures, it
is the fifth among the cities of the state. Its
most important industry is the manufacture
of silk products of all kinds. In this industry
it stands first among the cities of the country.
It has many other extensive industrial plants,
which include machine shops, foundries, rolling
mills, locomotive works, dyeing establishments,
and thread and cordage mills.</p>

<p><b>Passaic</b>, located on the Passaic River a few miles
southeast of Paterson, is specially noted for its
manufacture of woolen and worsted goods, in
which it is the first city of the state. It has other
extensive industries, including the manufacture
of handkerchiefs and other cotton goods, rubber
goods, belting and packing material, machinery,
metal, leather and silk goods, and print and
chemical works. Passaic is, besides, an attractive
residential city.</p>

<p>Northeast of Passaic is <b>Hackensack</b> on the
Hackensack River, which is a prosperous residential
town. Between Paterson and Passaic are
<b>Clifton</b>, a growing manufacturing town, <b>Lodi</b>, with
its extensive dyeing industry, and <b>Garfield</b> with
its large establishments for the manufacture of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">-xxiv-</span>
woolen and worsted goods, waxed paper, embroideries,
and yarns. Southwest of Paterson is
<b>Little Falls</b>, whose principal manufactures are
carpets and rugs. <b>Rutherford</b>, <b>Hasbrouck Heights</b>,
<b>Ridgewood</b>, and <b>Westwood</b> are towns in this section
which are specially inviting to residents.</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth and Neighboring Towns.</b>&mdash;Elizabeth is one of the oldest towns in the
state. It was settled in 1664 and was the
residence of Sir Philip Carteret, the first
Governor of New Jersey. It is most favorably
situated for both manufacturing and
residential purposes. Its location on Arthur
Kill and Newark Bay gives it deep water
connection through Kill van Kull with New
York Bay, and it has besides ample railroad
facilities. It has many industries, the largest
of which, and the largest of its kind in the
world, is the manufacture of sewing machines.
Other industries are the manufacture of iron
and steel products of all kinds, and of electrical
appliances, tanning, printing, and shipbuilding.
It has always been popular as a place
of residence with many whose business is in
New York.</p>

<p><b>Rahway</b>, a few miles southwest of Elizabeth, is a
flourishing city whose chief industries are the manufacture
of felt, cereals, steel products, clothing,
music boxes, and printing and book binding.
<b>Roselle</b>, <b>Roselle Park</b>, <b>Cranford</b>, and <b>Westfield</b>
are attractive residential towns west of Elizabeth,
with excellent educational facilities. <b>Garwood</b>, in
this vicinity, is an important manufacturing town.</p>

<p><b>Perth Amboy and Neighboring Towns.</b>&mdash;Perth
Amboy was settled in 1684 and alternated with Burlington as the meeting place
of the New Jersey assembly after the union
of the provinces in 1702. Its great industrial activity has increased its population by
more than 100 per cent in the last fifteen
years. Its rapid industrial growth is due to
its location at the mouth of the Raritan River
and on Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill, as well
as to its railroad facilities, and to the extensive
deposits of clay which are found here. The
development of these has led to the establishment
of large manufacturing plants whose
products are terra cotta, earthenware, and
tile of all kinds. Other important industries
are the refining of gold, silver, copper, and
lead, the preparation of vaseline, boat building,
the shipping of coal, and the manufacture
of cigars, insulated wire, chemicals, and steel
products. It is the fourth city in the state
in the value of manufactured products.</p>

<p>Near Perth Amboy are <b>Metuchen</b>, <b>Woodbridge</b>,
<b>South Amboy</b>, <b>Sayreville</b>, and <b>South River</b>, which
are populous towns and have extensive industries
similar to those of Perth Amboy. In <b>Woodbridge</b>
the output of fire brick is specially important.
In <b>Sayreville</b> and <b>South River</b> special attention is
given to the manufacture of building brick. In
all there is considerable shipping of clays to other
points. Many varied industries are found in
Carteret to the northeast of Woodbridge.</p>

<p><b>Places on the Outskirts of the Metropolitan
District of New York.</b>&mdash;Lying just beyond the
New York City Metropolitan District, yet
feeling its influence more and more as the
facilities for communication are increased,
are a number of important towns.</p>

<p><b>Morristown</b>, in Morris County, is famous because
of Its Revolutionary associations. It is
distinctively a residential town, which possesses
great municipal and educational advantages.
<b>Madison</b> is another residential town, whose peculiar
and most important industry is the cultivation of
roses. <b>Boonton</b> and <b>Dover</b> have picturesque locations
and are industrially active. Their chief
products are boilers, furnaces, hosiery, iron, hats,
and silk goods.</p>

<p>In Union County is <b>Plainfield</b>, which is well
known on account of its residential advantages, its
unexcelled schools, and its industrial importance.
Its principal manufactures are printing presses,
electrical appliances, garments, machine tools,
and machine shop products. <b>North Plainfield</b> is a
residential suburb.</p>

<p><b>Somerville</b> is an attractive and prosperous town
with industries which manufacture clothing, laces,
and iron pipe. <b>Bound Brook</b> is at the junction of
three trunk line railroads and is located on the
Raritan Canal. It is therefore an active industrial
center. At <b>Finderne</b>, between Somerville and
Bound Brook, are large asbestos works.</p>

<p><b>New Brunswick</b>, which was built up about the
ferry established here in 1697, is situated on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">-xxv-</span>
Raritan River and at the eastern end of the Raritan
Canal, and enjoys superior facilities for water and
railroad transportation. Its most extensive industry
is the manufacture of surgical dressings. Other
manufactured products are machinery, woolen
goods, iron and steel products, automobiles,
cigars, and wall paper. Here is situated Rutgers
College, which includes the State Agricultural
College and Experiment Station. The State
Home for Boys is located at <b>Jamesburg</b>. <b>Keyport</b>, with its fisheries and growing manufacturing
industries, is situated on lower New York Bay
and has rail and water connections with that city.
<b>Freehold</b> is always associated with the battle of
Monmouth. It has important canning and rug-making
industries.</p>

<p><b>Trenton and the Towns of the Upper Delaware Valley.</b>&mdash;Trenton, the capital of the
state since 1790, was settled about 1679.
Here occurred the Battle of Trenton, which is
commemorated by an imposing monument.
It is situated on the Delaware at the head
of navigation. The Delaware and Raritan
Canal passes through the city. It thus has
the advantage of transportation by water and
railway. The water power developed by
the Falls of the Delaware encouraged the
establishment and growth of the city's industries,
but these have grown so extensive
that they do not rely upon it. In the
neighborhood of Trenton are deposits of clay
which were the basis of the pottery industry.
It has forty-eight potteries and in this
industry it is rivaled by only one city in the
United States. The local clay is now used
very little. The better grades of pottery
require the finer clays which are obtained
from England, France, and some states of
this country. It manufactures more sanitary
earthenware than any other city in the country.
Other extensive industries are automobile
factories, iron and steel works, machine
shops, foundries, rubber works, woolen mills,
watch factories, and oilcloth and linoleum
factories.</p>

<p>The state and city acting together have
created a large public park which extends
along the Delaware River and includes the
grounds around the state capitol. The trade
of the surrounding country makes the city
a thriving business center.</p>

<p>Northeast of Trenton is <b>Princeton</b>, memorable
as the scene of the Battle of Princeton and rich
in historic associations. Here is located Princeton
University, founded in 1746.</p>

<p><b>Lambertville</b>, on the Delaware northeast of
Trenton, is a prosperous town with considerable
water power, whose principal industries are rock
quarries, rubber works, and canning factories.
<b>Pennington</b> and <b>Hopewell</b> in the interior are industrious
canning centers. At <b>Phillipsburg</b>, on the
Delaware, opposite the mouth of the Lehigh, five
railroads meet. It is the western terminus of the
Morris Canal. These transportation facilities
make it a strongly industrial town. Its principal
products are air compressors and rock drills, horseshoes,
canisters, iron pipe, boilers, and silks. The
principal cement works of the state are located
near Phillipsburg. <b>Belvidere</b>, on the Delaware
above Phillipsburg; <b>Washington</b>, <b>Hackettstown</b>,
and <b>Blairstown</b>, in the interior, are popular residential
towns. In <b>Washington</b> pianos and organs, and
in <b>Hackettstown</b> saws and leather, are the chief
industrial products. In <b>Hackettstown</b> and <b>Blairstown</b> well-known educational institutions are
located. <b>Newton</b> is located in the picturesque
mountain region of Sussex County. Here dairy
farming is important. Its chief manufactures are
shoes, silks, and dyeing.</p>

<p><b>Flemington</b> and <b>High Bridge</b>, in Hunterdon
County, though not located in the Delaware
Valley, are near it. They are important centers
of trade in agricultural sections with growing
industries. <b>High Bridge</b> is in the heart of the
peach-growing section and has large steel works.
So also <b>Franklin Furnace</b>, in Sussex County, is in
the Wallkill Valley and is the center of the zinc-mining
industry.</p>

<p><b>Camden and Neighboring Cities and Towns.</b>&mdash;In this group are included the towns
which are located in the southwestern part
of the state and which are usually considered
as belonging to the Metropolitan District of
Philadelphia or are near it. All are vitally
affected by its stimulating commercial and
industrial impulse.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Canning factory, filling and capping cans, Camden</p></div>
</div>

<p>The largest city of this group is <b>Camden</b>,
on the Delaware opposite Philadelphia,
founded about 1680 and known in colonial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">-xxvi-</span>
days as Cooper's
Ferry. It shares
with Philadelphia
the advantages of
the deep-water route
to the ocean through
the Delaware River
and Bay. It owes
Its first industrial
impulse to the opening
of the Camden
and Amboy Railroad.
From It many
railroads radiate to
all parts of the state
and one crosses the Delaware to Pennsylvania.
Direct communication with Philadelphia is
maintained by ferries. More rapid communication will soon
be obtained when
the proposed tunnels
under the Delaware
are completed. Its
industries, which are
of the most varied
character, have increased
with astonishing
rapidity. The
most extensive are
the manufacture of
talking machines and
shipbuilding. Here
the largest battleships
and merchant vessels can be built.
One of the shipbuilding plants is the largest
in the country. Other extensive industries
are foundries, machine shops,
woolen mills, chemical works,
factories for the manufacture
of cigars, paints, candies,
leather, licorice, linoleum,
writing pens, and the preparation of soups.</p>

  <div class="caption">Camden, Philadelphia, and vicinity</div>
</div>

<p>Northeast of Camden, on the
Delaware, are <b>Riverside</b> and
<b>Beverly</b>, which are important
centers of manufacture and of
truck farming. Farther up is
<b>Burlington</b>, which was settled in
1677 and was the capital of West
Jersey. It has ample facilities for
transportation by rail and water.
Its interests are both agricultural
and manufacturing. Its principal
products are shoes, iron pipe,
and hardware. <b>Bordentown</b>, the
southwestern terminus of the
Delaware and Raritan Canal, also
has excellent transportation facilities.
Its most important industries
are the canning of vegetables
and the manufacture of yarns and
clay products. In the interior,
the old town. <b>Mount Holly</b>, is rich
in agricultural products and has
industries which produce hosiery,
shoes, and tapestry goods. East
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">-xxvii-</span>
and southeast of Camden are <b>Merchantville</b>,
<b>Moorestown</b>, <b>Collingswood</b>, and <b>Haddonfield</b>, which
are distinctively residential towns, but in which
vegetable raising is an important industry.</p>

<p><b>Gloucester</b>, on the Delaware south of Camden,
is a growing industrial center. Its products are
yarns, paper, and gas mantles. It has communication
with Philadelphia by ferries, which transport
the produce of the rich truck and fruit farms of the
surrounding country to that city. <b>Woodbury</b> is a
prosperous residential town with industries which
make pianos and glass bottles. Next to the
southward are Swedesboro, <b>Glassboro</b>, and <b>Clayton</b>,
whose principal industrial activities are connected
with the making of glass and the raising and
canning of vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p><b>Towns near Delaware Bay.</b>&mdash;Farther south on
the outskirts of the Philadelphia Metropolitan
District are the very active business and industrial
center, <b>Salem</b>, settled by the Quakers
in 1675, <b>Bridgeton</b>, <b>Vineland</b>, and <b>Millville</b>.</p>

<p>In these towns the glass factories are extensive
and make all kinds of glass articles. In <b>Bridgeton</b>
and <b>Millville</b> many persons are employed in the
mining and shipping of glass sand. Molding
sand is also a product. In and surrounding these
towns are large areas of farm land devoted to the
raising of all kinds of vegetables, berries, and tree
fruits for the markets. Great quantities of these
are preserved in the many large canning factories
which are located in them. <b>Vineland</b> produces
much bottled grape juice. These towns have also
diversified industries of other kinds.</p>

<p>In <b>Cape May Court House</b> the important industrial
activities are the making of glass bottles and
the raising of berries and other fruits.</p>

<p><b>Cities and Towns on the Atlantic Coast.</b>&mdash;Along
the Atlantic coast are many cities and
towns which are popular health and pleasure
resorts. The many railroads which connect
them with the large cities have made them
convenient of access so that thousands of
people visit them in the summer time.</p>

<p>The largest of these is <b>Atlantic City</b>, which is the
largest seaside resort in the country and is devoted
entirely to the entertainment of visitors. It is
said to contain more than one thousand hotels.
Its permanent population numbers somewhat
more than 50,000, but in the summer time its
population is estimated at about 300,000. It has
a climate favorable to those who are convalescing
from illness or seek to recuperate their health.
On this account it is a popular resort during the
entire year. It has a superior school system
and all the other facilities and institutions which
mark the progressive city. <b>Long Branch</b>, farther
north, is the oldest resort on the coast. Another
resort of many years standing is <b>Cape May City</b>.
Other well-known resorts are <b>Ocean City</b>, <b>Point
Pleasant</b>, <b>Sea Girt</b>, <b>Manasquan</b>, <b>Spring Lake</b>,
<b>Belmar</b>, <b>Ocean Grove</b>, <b>Asbury Park</b>, <b>Sea Bright</b>,
and <b>Atlantic Highlands</b>. <b>Red Bank</b>, with its many
attractive country homes, is situated on the
Navesink and is classed as a seaside resort.</p>

<p><b>Lakewood</b>, among the pines of Ocean County,
is a popular winter health resort.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
